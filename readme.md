# Simpsons API

A simple flask application with a dockerfile included.

## What is it

Simpsons API is a small and simple flask application (written in Python using the Flask framework) to get random quotes from The Simpsons.

## Docker?

Docker is a container system, I've containerised/containerized this application as a learning exercise. With Docker installed on your machine, you can run `docker build .` when in the simpsonsapi/ directory. You can then run or deploy this container wherever you would like it. It uses port 80, so make sure that's opened up in your firewall.

## What's next

I would like to add more options in the API and rewrite the frontend in Vue.js, a JavaScript framework.
